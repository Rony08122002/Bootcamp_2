1. deep learning can understand image audio and more. 
2.its use 2 layers after the input in the layers he predict the data 
3. the deep learning use more parameters that can help him understand better the information 
4.overfitting, computational cost, lack of interpretability
5.deep learning automatically learn relevant featurs from the data,and not manual selection 
6. each hidden layer find parameters and usfull imformation from the input data to give the final result 
7.help neural networks find patterns and learn better
