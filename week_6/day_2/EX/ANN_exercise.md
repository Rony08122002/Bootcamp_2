# Exercise 2: Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

## 1. ANN Structure:

Input Layer (3 neurons) ➡️ Hidden Layer (4 neurons) ➡️ Output Layer (2 neurons)

## 2. Labeled Components:

- **Neurons:** Each neuron processes inputs and sends an output.
- **Weights:** Numbers representing the importance of inputs.
- **Biases:** Constants added to the weighted inputs to adjust activation.
- **Activation Function:** Determines if a neuron activates (e.g., sigmoid, ReLU).
- **Layers:** Groups of neurons organized in layers (Input, Hidden, Output).

## 3. Information Flow Explanation:

The information first enters the network through the input layer. Then, each neuron in the hidden layer takes these inputs, multiplies each one by weights, adds a bias, and applies an activation function. The activated values then move forward to the output layer, where this process repeats. The output layer generates the final output of the network, which could be a prediction or classification based on the inputs received.
